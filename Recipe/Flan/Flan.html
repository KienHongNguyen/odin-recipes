   <h1>Ingredients</h1>
   <ul>
        <li>6 eggs</li>
        <li>180g of sugar (30g per egg)</li>
        <li>600ml of milk (100ml per egg)</li>
        <li>150g of sugar for caramel</li>
        <li>60ml of water for caramel</li>
   </ul>

   <h1>Steps</h1>
   <ol>
        <li>Make the Caramel: In a saucepan, combine 150g sugar and 60ml water. Heat over medium, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves and turns into an amber-colored caramel, about 10 minutes. Immediately pour the caramel into a round baking pan or ramekins and tilt to coat the bottoms and sides. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Egg Mixture: Crack 6 eggs into a large bowl and whisk until fully combined.</li>
        <li>Heat the Milk: In a saucepan, heat 600ml milk over low heat. Add 180g white sugar and whisk continuously until the 180g sugar fully dissolves.</li>
        <li>Temper the Eggs: Slowly pour the warm milk mixture into the beaten eggs while whisking constantly to temper the eggs.</li>
        <li>Strain the Custard: Use a fine mesh strainer to strain the egg-milk mixture into a clean bowl or pitcher to remove any bits or foam.</li>
        <li>Fill the Ramekins: Slowly pour the strained custard over the caramelized sugar in the baking pan or ramekins.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Water Bath: Place the filled ramekins into a large baking pan or dish and pour hot water around them until it reaches about 1/4 up the sides.</li>
        <li>Bake the Flan: Preheat oven to 120Â°C. Carefully transfer the water bath to the oven. Bake for 45 minutes, checking every 15 minutes, until the flan is set but still jiggles slightly in the center.</li>
        <li>Cool and Chill: Remove from oven and water bath and let cool completely. Then refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.</li>
        <li>Unmold and Serve: To serve, run a knife carefully around the edges of the ramekins. Invert onto plates, allowing the caramel sauce to drizzle over the top.</li>
    </ol>
