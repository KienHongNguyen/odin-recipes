    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>500g porks belly</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon sugar (1 for pork, 1 for caramel)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon fish sauce (1 for marinate, 1 for sim)</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1/4 onion</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
            <li>1 coconut water</li>
        </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the Pork: Using a sharp knife, cut 500g of pork belly or shoulder into 2-3 inch cubes or chunks.</li>
            <li>Marinate the Pork: Place the cut pork pieces in a bowl. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, and 1 tablespoon fish sauce. Use your hands or a spoon to toss and coat the pork evenly with the marinade. Let it marinate for 15-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Prepare Aromatics: Peel and thinly slice 2 cloves of garlic. Also thinly slice 1/4 of a medium onion bulb.</li>
            <li>Cook Aromatics: In a heavy bottomed pan or pot, heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable or olive oil over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the sliced garlic and onion. Cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently, until fragrant and lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Cook the Pork: Remove the pork pieces from the marinade, reserving the liquid. Add the marinated pork pieces to the pan with the cooked aromatics. Cook for 2-3 minutes undisturbed to get a nice sear. Then continue cooking for 2-3 more minutes, turning occasionally until the pork is browned on all sides. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Make the Caramel: In a separate small pot or saucepan, add 1 tablespoon of white granulated sugar. Cook over medium heat, constantly swirling the pan, until the sugar fully melts and turns an amber caramel color, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Caramelize Evenly: Once a nice amber caramel forms, continue swirling the pot so the caramel coats the bottom and sides evenly. Allow to cook for 1-2 more minutes until it deepens to a reddish-brown color, being careful not to burn.</li>
            <li>Add Coconut Water and Pork: Working carefully as the caramel is very hot, slowly add about 1-1.5 cups of coconut water to the caramel pot. Stir and scrape up any caramel bits from the bottom. Then add the browned pork and juices.</li>
            <li>Simmer the Pork: Add enough water to the caramel pot to just cover the top of the pork pieces, about 1-1.5 cups. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat. Simmer for 45-60 minutes, adjusting heat as needed to maintain a low simmer, until pork is very tender and the braising liquid has thickened into a glaze, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Finish and Serve: Once pork is fork-tender, taste and adjust seasoning with more fish sauce, sugar or salt if needed. Transfer the braised caramelized pork (Thịt Kho) along with the sauce to a serving dish. Garnish with sliced green onions or chilies if desired. Serve hot over steamed jasmine rice.</li>
